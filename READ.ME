# Inventory System – Week 9

This project builds on the previous week's assignment and implements an **industrial inventory management system** using **C#**, **Avalonia UI**, and a **SQLite database**.  
The application reads queued orders from a local database (`inventory.sqlite`) and prints them to the console or displays them in a GUI.

---

## 📋 Requirements

✅ Use a database (`inventory.sqlite`) instead of static C# data.  
✅ Create the database with example inventory data from last week.  
✅ Replace the dictionary-based stock structure with a list (`List<Item>`) that includes a quantity property.  
✅ Modify the class diagram accordingly.  
✅ Demonstrate the system with queued orders being loaded and displayed.

## 🗄️ Database Structure (`inventory.sqlite`)

The database contains:
- `Items` table – stores all items in stock  
- `Orders` table – stores customer orders  
- `OrderLines` table – connects items to orders (many-to-one relationship)

## 🧠 Application Overview

- **DatabaseSetup.cs** – creates and initializes the SQLite database  
- **ReadData.cs / ReadOrders.cs** – reads orders and items from the database  
- **MainViewModel.cs** – contains logic for processing and displaying orders  
- **MainWindow.axaml** – defines the graphical user interface (GUI)  
- **Order.cs** – defines order, order line, and item models  
- **Program.cs** – application entry point  

When run, the application loads queued orders from `inventory.sqlite` and displays them like this:
